## About Me
I graduated from RTU in Moscow, with a degree in Business Informatics and worked as an implementer of the EMIAS Information System for 2 years. I was offered a job in Malaysia as a project manager at a Russian company. However, after a year of work, I realized that it's not for me, and I want to work in a field where my development depends solely on me. During my work, I often encountered web development, and this direction became interesting to me. I decided to delve deeper into this topic and realized that I want to become a front-end developer.

As for my personal qualities, I consider myself:
* communicative 
* stress-resistant 
* persevering
* resourceful

  for (let i = 0; i <= x.length - 1; i++) {
    if (x[i] < 5) {
       y = 0;
    } if (x[i] >= 5) {
      y = 1;
    }
    result = `${result}${y}`
